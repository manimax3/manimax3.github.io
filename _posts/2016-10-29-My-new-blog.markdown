So I finally found the time to create a blog. I will write about many things, including the projects I'm currently working on
and the problems I have to solve or stuff I plan to do in the near or far future.

For example some projects I plan to do in the future are

+ Virtual File System Library (C++, Multiplatform, Threaded)
+ 2D Game Engine (C++, Lua Scripting, Multiplatform)
+ Learn the cool new Vulkan API
+ and many more minor projects...

If you're interested in a specific topic related to gamedev or programming
be sure to leave a comment below.
